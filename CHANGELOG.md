# socketpush-web

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- # useSocketPush Hook – v0.7.1

  A lightweight, React-first WebSocket connection manager built around Socket.IO, offering safe connection handling, clean event management, and a developer-friendly API.

  ## Features

  ### Reactive Connection Management

  - Tracks socket connection state with `connectionState` (`"disconnected" | "connecting" | "connected" | "error"`).
  - Automatically attaches and cleans up connection listeners on mount/unmount.
  - Provides `connect()` and `disconnect()` functions with proper state transitions and error handling.

  ### Safe Command Execution

  All outbound functions ensure the socket is connected before proceeding:

  - `trigger()`
  - `join()`
  - `leave()`
  - `message()`
  - `roomEmit()`

  Prevents race conditions and silent failures by throwing if connection isn't ready.

  ### Real-Time Event Subscriptions

  Easily subscribe to events with the following methods:

  - `onMessage(callback)`
  - `onDelivery(callback)`
  - `onOnlineUsers(callback)`
  - `onOnlineStatus(callback)`
  - `onFetchUsers(callback)`
  - `onEvent(eventName, callback)` – supports custom event listeners

  Built-in cleanup ensures previous listeners are removed before new ones are registered.

  ### Strong Typing & Performance

  - All methods are fully typed with parameter inference from backend wrappers.
  - Uses `useCallback` to memoize handlers and avoid unnecessary renders.
  - Maintains all internal callbacks using `useRef` to preserve stability across renders.
